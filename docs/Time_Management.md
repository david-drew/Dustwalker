### Time Pressure Mechanics

**Quest Deadlines:**
- Some quests are time-sensitive (marked clearly)
- "Deliver medicine within 10 days"
- "Find the missing child before 5 days pass"
- Failure consequences range from reduced rewards to permanent quest failure

**Seasonal Changes:**
- Winter (Days 1-90 or 270-360, depending on start): Harsh survival, blocked passes
- Spring (Days 91-180): Flooding, mud, renewal
- Summer (Days 181-270): Drought risk, optimal travel
- Fall (Days 271-360): Harvest, preparation

**Faction Activities:**
- Factions pursue objectives on their own timelines
- Ignoring threats allows them to grow stronger
- "The Crimson Gang grows in power each week you don't stop them"

### Sleep System

**Optimal Sleep:** 2 consecutive turns (8 hours)
- Full fatigue recovery
- HP recovery (1-3 HP depending on conditions)
- Removes minor status effects

**Inadequate Sleep:**
- 1 turn (4 hours): 50% recovery, penalties remain
- 0 turns: Accumulating fatigue penalties

**Sleep Deprivation:**
- 1 night missed: -10% Perception, Reflex
- 2 nights missed: -20% Perception, Reflex, Wit, hallucination risk
- 3+ nights: Severe penalties, guaranteed hallucinations, health damage

**Sleep Quality Modifiers:**
- Bedroll + shelter + safe location: Best (bonus HP recovery)
- Bedroll + exposed: Normal
- No bedroll: 75% effectiveness
- Dangerous/uncomfortable: 50% effectiveness
