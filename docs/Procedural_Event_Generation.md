### Procedural Event Generation

**World State Tracker** maintains:

**Faction Activities:**
- Territory control (expands/contracts)
- War/peace status (relations shift)
- Resource needs (create opportunities)

**Example:** Army at war with tribe
- More patrols
- Burned villages
- Refugees
- Supply contracts available
- Danger in contested areas

**Economic Cycles:**
- Boom/bust (mining towns)
- Shortages (drought = high food prices)
- Trade disruption (bandit activity)

**Example:** Gold strike at Lucky Gulch
- Population boom
- High supply prices
- Lawlessness increase
- Claim jumping conflicts
- Guard jobs available

**Seasonal Effects:**
- Winter: Harsh survival, blocked passes
- Spring: Flooding, mud, renewed trade
- Summer: Optimal travel, drought risk
- Fall: Harvest, preparation, migration

**Story Threads (3-5 active):**
- Track ongoing plots
- Evolve with or without player

**Example Thread:** "Crimson Gang Rising"
- Day 1: Rumor of gang forming
- Day 20: Rob bank (if unchecked)
- Day 40: Control town (if still unchecked)
- OR: Player defeats early, thread closes, new one begins

**Dynamic Response:**
World reacts to player actions:
- Kill gang leader → gang weakens or splinters
- Help settlers → town prospers, expands
- Ignore plague → spreads to more locations
- Broker peace → trade routes open
