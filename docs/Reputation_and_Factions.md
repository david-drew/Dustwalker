### Reputation Scale

**-100 to +100 per faction**

**Reputation Tiers:**

| Range | Tier | Effects |
|-------|------|---------|
| -100 to -75 | HATED | Kill on sight, bounties, permanent hostility |
| -74 to -50 | HOSTILE | Attack if opportunity, refuse all service |
| -49 to -25 | DISTRUSTED | Watchful, +50% prices, no favors, limited dialogue |
| -24 to -10 | WARY | Neutral but suspicious, +20% prices |
| -9 to +9 | NEUTRAL | Default starting, normal prices and interactions |
| +10 to +24 | KNOWN | Friendly, -10% prices, share rumors |
| +25 to +49 | LIKED | -20% prices, share information, minor favors |
| +50 to +74 | RESPECTED | -30% prices, trust you, unique quests, assistance |
| +75 to +100 | HONORED | -40% prices, faction champion, unique rewards, allied status |

### Reputation Changes

**Actions that Affect Reputation:**

**Negative:**
- Kill faction member: -5 to -20 (leader = -40 to -60)
- Steal from faction: -10 to -30
- Betray faction: -25 to -50
- Attack settlement: -30 to -60
- Complete quest against faction: -15 to -40

**Positive:**
- Help faction member: +1 to +10
- Complete quest: +5 to +25 (major quest +30 to +50)
- Donate resources: +5 to +15
- Defend settlement: +20 to +40
- Broker peace: +25 to +50 (both factions)

**Visibility:**
- Actions in remote areas may not be known immediately
- Witnesses spread information
- High-profile actions (rob bank, save town) spread to ALL factions
- Can hide identity (mask, no witnesses) to avoid reputation change

**Example:**
- Rob bank in Dustwater wearing mask, no witnesses survive
- **Result:** Money gained, no reputation loss (until/if discovered)

**Example 2:**
- Save settler from wolves in front of witnesses
- **Result:** +5 Settlers (that town), +2 Law (good deed), rumor spreads

### Conflicting Loyalties

**Mutually Exclusive Relationships:**
- **Can't be Honored with both Law and Outlaws**
  - Reaching +50 with Law auto-lowers Outlaws to -25
  - Reaching +50 with Outlaws auto-lowers Law to -25

- **Can't be Honored with both Army and certain Tribal factions**
  - Depends on which tribe (some are allied, some hostile to Army)

- **Corporate vs Settlers often conflict**
  - Helping corporations may hurt settler reputation
  - Protecting settlers from corporate expansion angers corporations

**Strategic Choices:**
Player must choose alliances, can't please everyone.

**Neutral Path:**
- Possible to maintain +25 to +49 with multiple factions
- Never reaching Honored keeps options open
- Harder to get best benefits but more flexibility

Gang vs Law)
- Player can exploit (play both sides)

- Player inaction = world changes dramatically
