## PROGRESSION SYSTEMS

### Experience & Leveling

**Learn-by-Doing System** (Elder Scrolls-style):

**Skill Experience:**
- Each skill use grants 1-5 XP
  - **Trivial task:** 1 XP (shooting stationary target)
  - **Moderate task:** 2-3 XP (hunting, standard combat)
  - **Difficult task:** 4-5 XP (long-range shot, tough opponent)
  - **Impossible task:** 0 XP (can't learn from total failure)

**Skill Level Requirements:**
- 100 XP per level
- Higher levels need more successful uses:
  - 0→1: ~20 uses
  - 1→2: ~30 uses
  - 2→3: ~40 uses
  - 3→4: ~60 uses
  - 4→5: ~80 uses

**What Grants XP:**
- **Combat Skills:** Successful hits (more XP for difficult shots)
- **Survival:** Successful hunts, foraging, tracking
- **Social:** Successful persuasion, intimidation, deception
- **Utility:** Picked lock, crafted item, appraised correctly

**No Grinding:**
- Repeated trivial tasks give diminishing returns
- Shooting same stationary target 100 times = minimal XP after first few
- Must challenge yourself to improve

### Stat Advancement

**Trainer Locations:**
- Towns (basic trainers, stats to 4)
- Forts (military trainers, combat stats to 5)
- Rare specialists (hidden, stats to 6-7)

#### 2. Achievements (Free but Rare)

**Examples:**
- Survive 10+ deadly combats → +1 Grit
- Track prey successfully 50+ times → +1 Survival

- Solve 15+ complex problems → +1 Wit
