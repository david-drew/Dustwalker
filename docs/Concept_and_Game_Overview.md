## CORE CONCEPT & VISION

### High Concept
A single-player, procedurally generated RPG hex-crawl set in a fantasy Wild West, blending survival mechanics, tactical combat, and emergent storytelling. Players control a lone character navigating a dangerous frontier where supernatural elements lurk beneath the dusty surface.

### Design Pillars

1. **Meaningful Choice**
   - Every decision matters: route planning, resource management, dialogue options
   - Multiple solutions to problems (combat, stealth, social, creative)
   - Branching consequences that persist throughout playthrough

2. **Emergent Narrative**
   - Procedurally generated world with hand-crafted feel
   - Dynamic faction relationships respond to player actions
   - Stories emerge from gameplay, not just scripted events

3. **Survival Tension**
   - Resource scarcity creates constant planning pressure
   - Environmental hazards and needs drive exploration
   - Balance between pursuing objectives and staying alive

4. **Heroic Progression**
   - Start vulnerable, become competent (not superhuman)
   - Skill mastery feels earned through practice
   - Character growth enables new approaches to challenges

5. **Tactical Depth**
   - Combat rewards preparation, positioning, and smart play
   - Stealth and social options provide viable alternatives to violence
   - Information and planning are valuable resources

### Inspirations

**Board Games:**
- **Barbarian Prince / Drifter:** Event-driven hex exploration, resource management, solo play focus
- **Magic Realm:** Complex systems, hidden information, character variety, time pressure
- **Mage Knight:** Deck-building-style skill progression, scaling challenges, efficiency optimization

**Video Games:**
- **Classic RPGs:** Character builds, stat-based progression, emergent gameplay
- **Caves of Qud:** Procedural generation, rich systems interaction, depth over graphics
- **Roguelikes:** Permadeath options, procedural content, high replayability

### Target Experience

Players should feel like they're:
- **A wanderer** in a vast, uncaring frontier
- **A survivor** managing scarce resources against environmental threats
- **An explorer** discovering secrets and locations
- **A gunslinger** (or other archetype) whose skills define their approach
- **A participant** in a living world that changes with or without them
- **An author** of their own Western tale through emergent gameplay
