- Quest items

### Discovery Mechanics

**Initial Visibility:**
- Major towns and forts: Visible from start
- Roads: Visible
- Everything else: Hidden until discovered or revealed

**Discovery Methods:**

**1. Exploration (entering adjacent hex):**
- Automatically discover obvious features
- Perception check for hidden features
- Higher Perception = see from farther away

**2. Rumors (NPCs tell you):**
- Vague: "Treasure in the Badlands" (5-10 hex search area)
- Moderate: "Old mine near Red Rock" (2-3 hexes)
- Specific: "Mine at base of Eagle Peak, three stones mark entrance" (exact hex)

**3. Maps (found or purchased):**
- Treasure maps (lead to specific caches)
- Regional maps (reveal terrain and some locations)
- Outlaw maps (hideout locations)

**4. Tracking (following NPCs/trails):**
- Follow tracks to camps or locations
- Blood trails to wounded prey/enemies
- Wagon ruts to settlements

**5. High ground (scouting):**
- From mountains/hills, can see 3-5 hexes in clear weather
- Perception check reveals distant locations
- Smoke, lights visible at night

**6. Information gathering:**
- Listening to conversations
- Reading newspapers
- Studying found documents

### Stealth and Encounter Awareness

**IMPORTANT MECHANIC:**

When entering a new hex, **Stealth and Perception checks occur BEFORE encounter triggers:**

**Check Process:**
1. Player enters hex
2. Stealth check (player's Stealth vs encounter's Perception)
3. If successful:
   - Player receives **hint** about encounter (not 100% accurate)
   - "You spot tracks suggesting 3-4 people ahead"
   - "You smell smoke and hear voices - possibly a camp"
   - "Fresh blood trail leads into the canyon"
4. Player chooses:
   - **Engage encounter** (proceed as normal)
   - **Avoid encounter** (circle around, costs extra time - 1 additional turn)
   - **Prepare first** (set up ambush, position advantageously)

**Benefits:**
- Rewards high Stealth investment
- Gives player agency (choose fights)
- Doesn't remove content (can still engage)
- Adds tactical layer (ambush opportunities)

**Hint Accuracy:**
- Low Perception: Vague hint, may be wrong about numbers/type
- High Perception: Accurate details, know exactly what you're facing
- Critical success: Perfect information + positioning advantage

### Fast Travel

**Not traditional fast travel, but shortcuts:**

**Roads:**
- Increase movement speed
- Safer (lower encounter rate)
- Connect major settlements

**Horses:**
- Double overland speed on good terrain
- Can push for extra movement (stamina cost)

**Known Routes:**
- Once you've traveled a path, navigation is easier
- Can mark "safe routes" on map
- Reduced chance of getting lost

**Guides:**
- Hire NPCs to lead you (costs money)
- They know shortcuts
- May reveal hidden locations

### Environmental Storytelling

**Abandoned Locations:**
- Burned homestead (bandit attack? Wildfire?)
- Massacred wagon train (investigation reveals story)
- Ghost towns (what happened here?)

**Evidence of Events:**
- Recent battlefields (bodies, shell casings, which factions?)
- Animal kill sites (predator type, danger level)
- Campsites (who was here, when, which way did they go?)

**Dynamic World:**
- Locations change over time (prosperity or decline)
- Your actions leave traces (bodies, structures you build)
- NPCs react to what you've done nearby
