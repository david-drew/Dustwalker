## SURVIVAL SYSTEMS

### Food System

**Daily Requirement:** 1 ration per day

**Food Types:**
All convert to rations (0.5 or 1.0) under the hood, but named differently:

- **Trail Rations** (1.0) - $2-5 each, never spoils, compact
- **Fresh Meat** (1.0) - From hunting, spoils in 2-3 days
- **Preserved Food** (1.0) - Jerky, hardtack, canned goods, $1-3, lasts weeks
- **Foraged Food** (0.5) - Free but requires foraging action
- **Cooked Meals** (1.0) - Purchased in towns, $1-2, immediate consumption

**Game Animals:**
- Rabbit: 0.5 rations

- Elk: 5.0 rations
- Buffalo: 8.0 rations (requires group or preservation)

**Hunger Stages:**
- **Well-Fed:** Normal stats
- **Peckish** (1 day missed): -5% to physical stats, minor discomfort

- **Starving** (3 days): -20% all stats, 1 HP loss per day
- **Near Death** (5 days): -40% all stats, 2 HP loss per day
- **Death** (7+ days without food)

**Food Preservation:**
- Smoking meat: Extends life to 7-10 days (requires tools, time)
- Salting: Permanent preservation (requires salt, expensive)
- Canning: Permanent (requires equipment, rare)

### Water System

**Requirement:** Every 4 turns (twice per day minimum)

**Water Sources:**
- Waterskin (holds 2-4 drinks, refillable)
- Rivers, streams, springs (free, must be at location)
- Wells (in settlements, free)

- Rain collection (during storms, free)
- Cactus/plants (foraging in desert, 0.5 drinks)

**Dehydration Stages:**
- **Hydrated:** Normal
- **Thirsty** (1 period missed): -10% Reflex, Fortitude
- **Parched** (2 periods): -20% physical, -10% mental, descriptions of dry mouth
- **Severe Dehydration** (3 periods): -40% all stats, 2 HP loss per period
- **Death** (5 periods)

**Environmental Modifiers:**
- **Desert/Summer:** Water consumption doubles
- **Cool/Winter:** Normal consumption
- **Heavy activity (combat, running):** +1 drink required

**Water Quality:**
- Clean (rivers in mountains, wells): Safe
- Questionable (stagnant, downstream): Fortitude save or disease
- Contaminated (obvious pollution): Guaranteed disease unless boiled

### Temperature & Weather

**Temperature Zones:**
- **Extreme Cold** (<20°F): Frostbite risk, 1 HP per turn exposed without proper gear
- **Cold** (20-40°F): Requires warm clothing, stamina drain
- **Comfortable** (40-80°F): No penalties
- **Hot** (80-100°F): Increased water consumption
- **Extreme Heat** (>100°F): Heat exhaustion risk, 1 HP per turn without shade/water

**Clothing/Gear Protection:**
- **Winter coat:** Protects to 0°F
- **Light clothing:** Comfortable range only
- **Desert gear:** Protects from heat to 110°F

**Weather Events:**

**Clear** (60% of days): Normal conditions

**Light Rain/Wind** (20%): 
- Minor visibility reduction
- Tracking becomes harder
- No major penalties

**Severe Weather** (15%):
- **Thunderstorm:** Forced to seek shelter or take 1d6 damage, visibility zero, flash flood risk in canyons
- **Blizzard:** Vision range 1 hex, movement halved, hypothermia risk, can get lost
- **Sandstorm:** Vision zero, movement impossible, must seek shelter
- **Tornado:** Extreme danger, evacuation event

**Extreme Weather** (5%):
- **Flash Flood:** If in canyon/riverbed, Reflex save or swept away (major damage/death)
- **Wildfire:** Smoke inhalation, burns, evacuation required
- **Hailstorm:** Damage to exposed characters and horses

**Weather Prediction:**
- High Survival skill: 1 turn warning of severe weather
- Cloud reading: Hints at coming conditions
- NPCs warn of seasonal patterns

### Disease & Injury

**Wounds (from combat, falls, accidents):**
- **Light Wounds** (1-3 HP): Heal naturally in 1-2 days
- **Serious Wounds** (4-6 HP): Require Medicine skill + supplies, 5-10 days recovery
- **Critical Wounds** (7+ HP): Risk of permanent penalties, need expert treatment, 15-30 days

**Wound Complications:**
- **Untreated wounds:** Daily Fortitude save or infection sets in
- **Infection:** +1 HP loss per day, fever (-20% all stats), requires medicine or death in 5-7 days
- **Blood loss:** Immediate HP loss continues without bandaging

**Diseases:**

**Common:**
- **Dysentery** (bad water/food): -10% stats, lasts 3-5 days, Medicine check or natural recovery
- **Fever** (exposure, infection): -15% stats, hallucinogenic effects, 5-7 days
- **Food Poisoning** (spoiled food): Vomiting, -20% stats for 1-2 days

**Serious:**
- **Cholera** (contaminated water): -30% stats, rapid dehydration, death in 3-5 days without treatment
- **Typhoid** (poor sanitation): Severe fever, -40% stats, weeks to recover or death
- **Plague** (rare, rats, fleas): Extremely dangerous, spreads to others, high mortality

**Supernatural:**
- **Lycanthropy** (werewolf bite): Transform at full moon, lose control
- **Vampire's Kiss** (vampire attack): Stat drain, light sensitivity, bloodlust

- **Doctors** in towns can treat for fee ($10-50)
- **Herbalists/Shamans** can cure with rare ingredients

### Fatigue System

**Fatigue Sources:**
- Insufficient sleep
- Strenuous combat
- Extended travel without rest
- Environmental stress (heat, cold, altitude)

**Fatigue Levels:**
- **Rested:** Normal performance
- **Tired:** -10% Reflex, Aim
- **Exhausted:** -20% all physical stats
- **Collapsing:** -40% all stats, risk of passing out

**Recovery:**
- Good sleep (2 turns): Full recovery
- Rest action (dedicated): Recover 1 level
- Stimulants (coffee, drugs): Temporary +1 level, crash afterward

### Resource Management Strategies

**Efficient Travel:**
- Stock up in towns (buy rations in bulk when cheap)
- Hunt/forage along the way (supplementing, not replacing)
- Plan routes through water sources
- Cache supplies at known locations for return trips

**Emergency Measures:**
- Rationing (1 ration stretches to 2 days, with penalties)
- Risky foraging (try unknown plants, disease risk)
- Desperate hunting (attract predators)
- Eat horse (last resort, lose transportation)

**Weather Preparation:**
- Carry warm clothing even in summer (mountain passes)
- Extra water in desert regions
- Tent/shelter for storms
- Know safe havens (caves, abandoned buildings)
