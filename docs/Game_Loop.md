## CORE GAME LOOP

### Macro Loop (Full Playthrough)
```
1. Character Creation → Choose background, starting stats, primary objective
2. World Generation → Procedural map, factions, NPCs, quest chains created
3. Exploration Phase → Move through world, discover locations, gather resources
4. Encounter Resolution → Combat, social, discovery events
5. Progression → Gain skills, improve stats, acquire better equipment
6. Objective Pursuit → Complete quests, build reputation, pursue goals
7. Climax → Major confrontation or achievement of primary objective
8. Conclusion → Multiple possible endings based on choices and faction standings
```

### Mid Loop (Daily Cycle)
```
Day broken into 6 turns (4 hours each):
- Turn 1-2: Travel, exploration, morning activities
- Turn 3-4: Midday activities, hunting, social encounters
- Turn 5-6: Evening activities, camp setup, sleep (2 turns for optimal rest)

Each turn:
1. Choose major action (move, hunt, forage, social, rest, etc.)
2. Resolve any encounters triggered by location/action
3. Update needs (hunger, thirst, fatigue)
4. Check for environmental/story events
5. Update world state (faction movements, time-sensitive quests)
```

### Micro Loop (Encounter)
```
1. Encounter triggered (combat, social, discovery)
2. Player assesses situation (information gathering)
3. Player chooses approach (fight/talk/sneak/flee/creative)
4. Resolution mechanics execute (combat system, skill checks, etc.)
5. Outcome applied (loot, reputation change, quest progress, wounds)
6. World state updates (bodies remain, NPCs remember, consequences)
```

### Engagement Hooks
- **Short-term:** "Can I make it to the next town with my current supplies?"
- **Mid-term:** "How do I track down the next quest objective?"
- **Long-term:** "Can I achieve my character's ultimate goal?"
- **Emergent:** "What will I discover over that ridge?" / "How will this faction war play out?"
