# Character System Addendum: Spirit Stat & Survival Skill

## SPIRIT (Stat)

**Spirit** replaces Survival as the 8th core stat.

### Description
Mental fortitude, willpower, and supernatural sensitivity. Spirit represents a character's inner strength, their connection to the unseen world, and their ability to resist psychological and supernatural threats.

### Affects
- **Fear Resistance:** Checks to resist intimidation, horror, and panic
- **Morale:** Social combat defense, resistance to demoralization
- **Supernatural Encounters:** Saving throws against curses, possession, and mental attacks
- **Visions/Insight:** Ability to perceive supernatural phenomena, interpret omens
- **Willpower:** Resisting temptation, addiction, and compulsion

### Derived Benefits
- Social combat defense bonus
- Supernatural resistance saves
- Fear/panic threshold

### Advancement Triggers
- Survive supernatural encounters
- Resist fear or intimidation in dangerous situations
- Complete spiritually significant acts (rituals, sacred oaths)
- Overcome personal demons or temptations
- Witness horrors and maintain composure

### Thematic Fit
Spirit pairs with **Fortitude** to create a complete resilience picture:
- **Fortitude** = Physical resilience (disease, poison, fatigue, environment)
- **Spirit** = Mental/supernatural resilience (fear, curses, willpower, morale)

## SURVIVAL (Skill Cluster)

Survival is now a **skill category** rather than a stat, containing:

### Skills in Survival Category

1. **Tracking** (0-5)
   - Following trails, identifying signs
   - Reading footprints, disturbed vegetation
   - Linked stat: **Wit** (interpreting clues)

2. **Foraging** (0-5)
   - Finding edible plants, clean water sources
   - Identifying medicinal herbs
   - Linked stat: **Wit** (knowledge) or **Fortitude** (safe consumption)

3. **Hunting** (0-5)
   - Stalking game, setting traps
   - Field dressing, preserving meat
   - Linked stat: **Stealth** (stalking) or **Aim** (the shot)

4. **Navigation** (0-5)
   - Reading terrain, using landmarks
   - Weather prediction, finding shelter
   - Linked stat: **Wit** (mental mapping)

### Roll Formula
`d10 + Linked Stat + Skill Level vs Difficulty`

Example: Tracking a wounded deer
- Roll: d10 + Wit + Tracking vs DC 12
- Character with Wit 3, Tracking 2 rolls d10+5

### Why This Works
- **No redundancy:** Stats and skills serve different purposes
- **Flexibility:** Different survival tasks use different stats
- **Specialization:** A character can be a master tracker but poor hunter
- **Progression:** Skills advance through use, stats through training/achievements
