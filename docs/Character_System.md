### Character Progression Philosophy

**Early Game (Days 1-60):**
- Vulnerable, most encounters are dangerous
- Learning core skills (0→2)
- Acquiring basic equipment
- Establishing faction relationships

**Mid Game (Days 60-180):**
- Competent, can handle most standard threats
- Specializing skills (2→4 in chosen areas)
- Acquiring quality equipment
- Pursuing major objectives

**Late Game (Days 180-360+):**
- Formidable, feared or respected
- Mastering key skills (4→5)
- Acquiring legendary/unique equipment
- Resolving major story arcs

**Power Ceiling:**
A fully developed character should be able to:
- Defeat 5-10 standard enemies with preparation
- Survive most environmental hazards
- Handle one "boss" level encounter
- BUT still be threatened by overwhelming numbers or exceptional enemies
- Heroic, not superheroic
